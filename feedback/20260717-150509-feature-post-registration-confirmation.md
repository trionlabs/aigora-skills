### Surface
Registration

### Network
Mainnet — Celo (chainId 42220)

### Problem / motivation
Registering AnyPay on mainnet worked end to end — both signatures confirmed, the ERC-8004 NFT was minted (agent #9697), and the metadata pinned to IPFS. But immediately after the final signature there was no confirmation of success, and the agent did not appear in "My Agents" or on its profile page for a while. With no "registered" state and no "indexing…" indicator, it genuinely looked like the registration had failed. I only became confident it had worked by checking the identity registry and the pinned IPFS metadata on-chain myself — which most builders won't do. That gap between "the transaction succeeded" and "I can see my agent" is the single roughest moment in an otherwise smooth flow.

### Proposed feature
Add an explicit post-registration confirmation state:
1. After the final signature confirms, show a success screen with the new agent ID and a direct link to the profile (`…/services/<id>`).
2. On "My Agents" and the profile page, optimistically render the just-registered agent from data the client already has (the tx receipt gives the agent ID; the app just pinned the metadata), with a small "indexing — live shortly" badge while the backend catches up, instead of showing an empty state that reads as failure.

### Alternatives
Poll the identity registry for the new tokenId after the tx confirms and render a lightweight card (name + avatar + "indexing") from the pinned metadata until the indexer picks it up. Even just a toast — "Agent #9697 registered — it may take a minute to appear" — would remove almost all of the doubt.

### Anything else
Two minor notes from the same flow: (1) the cover-image field is labeled "IPFS link", but an `https://` URL works fine — the label could say "IPFS or https"; (2) for a payments/FX agent there was no fitting Category (closest were Automation and Trading) — a Payments / DeFi bucket would improve discovery for this growing class of agents.
